## 📘 Overview

This repository contains automated UI tests for the OpenMRS healthcare management system. The objective of this project is to ensure that the system’s core functionalities—such as authentication, patient management, and appointment scheduling—operate as expected.

All automated tests are executed on the official OpenMRS Demo Environment:

## 🧰 Technology Stack

* **Language:** Java
* **Frameworks:** Selenium WebDriver, TestNG
* **Design Pattern:** Page Object Model (POM)
* **Build Tool:** Maven
* **Reporting Tools:** Allure / Extent Reports
* **Supported Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari
* **Environment:** [OpenMRS Demo](https://o2.openmrs.org/openmrs/login.htm)
```

## 🧪 Testing Approach

* Structured using the Page Object Model for maintainable and scalable test code.
* Tests are grouped into Smoke, Regression, and Patient Management categories.
* Uses TestNG `@DataProvider` for data-driven scenarios.
* Priorities define execution order, ensuring critical flows are tested first.
* Generates comprehensive Allure/Extent HTML reports after execution.

## ✅ Key Validation Points

* UI component visibility and accessibility
* Accurate success and error message handling
* Positive and negative scenario validation
* Cross-browser consistency checks
* Dynamic and reusable page methods with synchronization using explicit waits
